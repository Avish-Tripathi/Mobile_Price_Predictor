# Mobile Price Predictor
Welcome !
This is a web app designed by me using Machine learning algorithms and Flask. I have used K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm using the features entered by the user to classify the price range ranging from low price to very high price.

All the features are compulsory to be entered by the user, and based on the values given, the model will predict whether the price of the required mobile will be low or high.

After predicting the range, the app displays range in different colours according to the level and it's according to the latest trend.

There is a link below the range which is activated only when all the entries are fulfilled and the range is predicted. The link will differ according to the level of price and on clicking, will display the phones in the predicted level.

Hope this can help you in some way !!

Thank You !
